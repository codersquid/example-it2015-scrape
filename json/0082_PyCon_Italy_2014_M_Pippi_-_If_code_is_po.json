  "summary": "Yes, code might be poetry, showing the elegance of the verses, rhythm, expressiveness; but without good documentation that explains what it does, you will likely end up with unsatisfied users or no users at all.\n\nIf anyone had told me I would have spent more time writing documentation than coding, I would not have believed it, but that was before I discovered a simple but powerful law: \"more documentation, more users, more contributors\".\n\nDuring the talk we will see which are the foundations of good documentation and how documentation can let your open source project take off.",
